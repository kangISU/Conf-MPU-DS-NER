FINDINGS O 0

BACKGROUND O 0
: O 0
Glioblastoma B-Disease 0
is O 0
a O 0
malignant B-Disease 0
tumor I-Disease 0
that O 0
occurs O 0
in O 0
the O 0

during O 0

. O 0

With O 0
current O 0
treatment O 0
regimens O 0
including O 0

, O 0
the O 0

of O 0
the O 0
patients O 0
is O 0

Therefore O 0
, O 0
patients O 0

intracarotid O 0

However O 0
, O 0
we O 0
experienced O 0

RESULTS O 0

CONCLUSION O 0
: O 0
When O 0

we O 0

that O 0
this O 0

, O 0
one O 0
drawback O 0
of O 0
such O 0

the O 0

indicate O 0
that O 0

As O 0
a O 0
result O 0
of O 0
these O 0
and O 0
other O 0

, O 0
phenacetin B-Chemical 1

now O 0
been O 0
withdrawn O 0

However O 0
, O 0
three O 0

Maryland O 0

West O 0

Germany O 0

showed O 0
that O 0

also O 0
associated O 0
with O 0
chronic B-Disease 0

These O 0

suggest O 0
that O 0
both O 0

contribute O 0

the O 0
former O 0
. O 0

This O 0
apparent O 0
difference O 0
in O 0
risk O 0
may O 0
not O 0
be O 0
due O 0
to O 0
differences O 0
in O 0
nephrotoxic B-Disease 0
potential O 0
of O 0
the O 0
drugs O 0
themselves O 0
. O 0

A O 0
lower O 0
relative O 0
risk O 0
would O 0
be O 0
expected O 0
for O 0
acetaminophen B-Chemical 0
if O 0
the O 0
risk O 0
of O 0
both O 0
drugs O 0
in O 0
combination O 0
with O 0

was O 0
higher O 0
than O 0
the O 0
risk O 0
of O 0
either O 0
agent O 0

Thus O 0
, O 0
acetaminophen B-Chemical 0
has O 0
been O 0

whereas O 0
phenacetin B-Chemical 1
was O 0
available O 0
only O 0

. O 0

The O 0
possibility O 0
that O 0
habitual O 0
use O 0

increases O 0
the O 0
